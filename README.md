# E-Commerce-Sales-Report

# Aim

The aim of this E-Commerce Sales Report dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance across multiple dimensions such as month, gender, region, sales channels, and product categories. The dashboard helps in understanding trends, identifying top-performing areas, and tracking customer preferences to optimize future business strategies.

# Objective
1. To analyze sales trends across different time periods, channels, and customer demographics.
2. To understand order statuses, gender-based sales distributions, and regional sales performance.
3. To help business stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve sales, reduce cancellations, and increase customer satisfaction.

# Project Learning
1. Data Visualization: The dashboard effectively uses pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts to present the sales data, making it easy to understand different aspects of sales performance across various filters such as month, channel, category, and region.
2. Sales Insights: Insights derived from gender-based and age-based ordering patterns, top-performing states, and channels can help in tailoring marketing strategies and sales approaches to target specific groups.
3. Interactive Design: The inclusion of slicers (filters for months, channels, and product categories) provides users with the ability to customize their view and extract specific insights based on their requirements.

# Analysis
1. Sales by Gender
  a) Men: 30.58% of sales.
  b) Women: 69.42% of sales.

Women dominate the sales demographic, contributing significantly more to the total orders. This insight suggests that marketing strategies should prioritize women-centric product categories and promotions.

2. Order Status
  a) Delivered: 92.25% of orders.
  b) Cancelled: 2.72%.
  c) Refunded: 3.37%.
  d) Returned: 1.67%.

The vast majority of orders are successfully delivered, with a small percentage experiencing cancellations, refunds, or returns. This indicates efficient order fulfillment but leaves room for improvement in customer satisfaction.

3. Order vs. Sales Trend (Monthly)
  a) Peak sales occurred between February and May.
  b) A steady decline in sales from June to December, indicating possible seasonal factors or marketing lapses.

Sales performance is strong early in the year but weakens towards the end. Seasonal promotions or marketing boosts may be needed to maintain higher sales in the latter half of the year.

4. Sales by Top 5 States
  a) Maharashtra: Highest sales.
  b) Karnataka.
  c) Uttar Pradesh.
  d) Telangana.
  e) Tamil Nadu.

The top states are geographically diverse, with Maharashtra leading. These insights can help businesses target specific regions with localized promotions and inventory planning.

5. Channel Sales
  a) Amazon: 35.48% of sales.
  b) Flipkart: 23.36%.
  c) Ajio: 21.59%.
  d) Meesho, Myntra, and others: Smaller portions of total sales.

Amazon dominates as the leading channel for sales, followed by Flipkart and Ajio. Businesses could focus more on Amazon for inventory placement and marketing, while working to grow sales on other platforms.

6. Order by Age vs Gender
  a) Adults (Men and Women): Majority of sales.
  b) Teenagers and Seniors: A smaller portion of sales.

Adults are the primary customers, with women leading the purchases. Focusing marketing efforts on adults, especially women, would yield the most significant returns.
